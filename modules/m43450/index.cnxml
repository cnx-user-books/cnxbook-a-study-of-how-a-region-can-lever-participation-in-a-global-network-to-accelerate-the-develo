      <para id="import-auto-id1167556955856">By looking at the regional academic publications output, bibilometrics and expertise that are accessible to companies. Kostoff et al. 2007 looked at the breakdown of nanoscience/nanotechnology article production by countries in percentage shares for the same three selected years <link target-id=" import-auto-id6130351"/>. The numbers in parentheses above the bars are actual numbers of papers produced for the year in question. Kostoff argues that over the time period of 1991 to 2005, the United States’ and Japan’s shares of global nanotechnology/nanoscience publications dropped (the US from 36% to 23%, and Japan 16.5% to 12.5%), as countries that were not as prolific at the beginning of the 1990s grew rapidly over the course of the decade, notably, China and South Korea both published about forty times more research articles in 2005 than in 1991 (Kostoff et al. 2007). The other leading countries increased their output by at most five times, although quantity of publications is a metric the quality of the publications and relevance is key to both small and large companies as can be seen in <link target-id=" import-auto-id1167549741812"/> and the locations that were chosen as areas of operation.  </para><figure id="import-auto-id6130351"><media id="import-auto-id1167544245579" alt="">

For example, Youtie et al. (2008) find that Europe, the US and Japan, as might be expected, are prominent in terms of the number of nanotechnology publications (<link target-id=" import-auto-id6820711"/>). However, nanotechnology publications in several other Asian countries is growing at rapid rate, especially in China, which is now the world’s second largest producer of nanotechnology research publications after the United States (Shapira and Wang 2009). The rise of China in the new domain of nanotechnology represents a significant change in the global technology development landscape, especially as institutional, regulatory, commercialization, and socio-economic frameworks differ in China from those typically found in fully developed economies. Nanotechnology R&amp;D is also emerging in selected other developing countries, including in Latin America (Kay and Shapira 2009), although generally most developing countries have limited capabilities not only to undertake R&amp;D in nanotechnology but also to manage and regulate its deployment (Burgi and Pradeep 2006). </para><figure id="import-auto-id6820711"><media id="import-auto-id1167551586819" alt="">

        <para id="import-auto-id1167547807497">For the purpose of this study it is important to peel the layers back to reveal the core local and academic Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for this study. Although there has been work done in relations to identifying bibilometrics and citations of singular universities and in the context of the USA; States with publications in nano; little work has been done to look at Swansea University and in particular Wales in the context of the United Kingdom over a period of time. Though Swansea University is located within Wales and that Wales is within the United Kingdom it is important to identify these relevant outputs. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167559073289">It can be seen in <link target-id=" import-auto-id1167555320281"/> that at the onset during the period of 2002 – 2004 Swansea made up 22% of Welsh and 25% of the United Kingdom publications in “nano” interestingly at the same period of time Swansea University was awarded funding for the Multidisciplinary Nanotechnology Centre. It can also be seen that over the following periods 2004-2006 and 2006-2008 that the journal article outputs in Swansea, Wales and the United Kingdom increased, identifying “nano” as a research growth area. Also within the following period of and 2008 – present there was an increase in the journal article outputs for Wales and the United Kingdom. </para><figure id="import-auto-id1167555320281"><media id="import-auto-id6676832" alt="">

        <para id="import-auto-id1167549081217">In 2006 NAoMITEC put out two reports investigated the strengths of micro– and nanotechnology in Europe in a sector specific and country specific breakdown. Within the Country Report and Sector Report: Health it was seen that the University of Wales Swansea Multidisciplinary Nanotechnology Centre were capitalising and taking the lead in Wales.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id3021924">The NAoMITEC reports highlight current availabilities and capacities within the European Union and identified that nanotechnology opens-up a multitude of new and improved applications in the biomedical field and that these applications would be for diagnostic or therapeutic use. They also highlighted that nanotechnology applications would also cover areas such as tissue engineering, biocompatible implants or bioactive materials. The report also identified low hanging fruit that could be quick wins within current trends as being; further biochip miniaturisation, advances of lab-on-chip applications and for longer periods of imaging techniques enhanced by nano-enabled contrast agents. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167541664667">The reports went on to say that within previous years many of the start-up companies and SMEs set to work on developing ambitious new products.  Yet many of them lack the funds that are needed for the lengthy phase of developments, demonstration and deployment. Therefore SMEs were recommended to concentrate on Research and Technical Development projects as a short-term step promising a sort of early return on investment.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id8895787">Following a report by the House of Lords Science and Technology Select Committee on Nanotechnologies and Food, January 2009, on nano and food safety, the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills were asked to respond. In March 2007 the Medical Research Council (MRC) issued a ‘highlight notice’ to encourage applications in nanotoxicology with the aim to inform policy development. The notice proved successful in stimulating a significant increase of applications and that since its launch five awards had been made at a total level of approximately £3 million. The research was focused on better understand the uptake of nanoparticles into cells and the functional consequences including oxidative stress, inflammatory response, cell death and genotoxicity, by linking this information to the physical and chemical characteristics of nanoparticles, predictive models for nanoparticle toxicity can be developed that will help risk assessment. </para>

This was followed by firms that identified themselves as Hi-Tech/Telecom with 67% of its respondents has less than 100 employees with both Manufacturing and Other having 58% of their respondents with under 100 employees. Inclusive to this was the 70% differential between the respondents of companies with less than 100 employees and those that had over 100 employees.  Where as both Manufacturing and Other had about a 15% differential between companies with less than 100 employees and companies with more than 100 employees.  When looking at revenue size by sector of respondents it is interesting to find that within Bio-Tech again took the lead with 98% of the respondents who identified themselves as operating within that sector had annual revenue of less than £10m. Bio-Tech was followed by Hi-Tech/Telecom with 75% of its respondents under the threshold of £10m annual revenue yet the differential between the companies with annual revenue of over £10m was only 50%. Interestingly though was that within the companies that fell outside of Bio-Tech, Manufacturing, and Hi-Tech/Telecom, noted as Other, 57% of those respondents had an annual revenue of over £10m.  Looking both at company size and annual revenue it can be said that all three of the sectors identified are growth sectors, with Bio-Tech being clearly in the lead. </para>

        <para id="import-auto-id1167557663643">Bio-Tech with 85% under 100 employees and 92% with annual revenues would be more in the areas of Application and Product Innovation at the stages of Early Market/Emerging Industry where the primary concern is raising funds to engage in early stage R&amp;D, i.e., Application Innovation (creating differentiation by finding and exploiting a new application or use for an existing technology, the cornerstone of solution-oriented marketing (Moore 2005)) or Product Innovation (An innovation type in the product leadership zone that differentiates a growth market position by R&amp;D to improve. (Moore 2005)), these companies are in the development stages and can be there for long periods, as the case is in pharmaceutical developments.  These companies generally are high risk high return and often receive first stage investment from “Friends &amp; Family” or Regional Funding Mechanisms.  Being at the early stages of development also means that those companies are looking to innovate and seek assistance in several forms. Hi-Tech/Telecom with 67% under 100 employees and 75% under £10m in annual revenue would be more situated at a Process Innovation stage (a next generation of emerging offerings (Moore 2005)). Where as Manufacturing and Other had 58% less than 100 employees and Manufacturing had 68% with annual revenues under £10m, Other had 42% with annual revenue less than £10m and 58% with over £10m annual revenue.</para>

        <title>Companies by Operating Territories</title>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167559085317">Access to markets is an important factor to any companies no mater its size or annual revenue.  Davies &amp; Weinstein 1999 argued the evidence of the importance of increasing returns, in combination with comparative advantage resulting in the importance of market access in economic geography of course included in these comparative advantages are also regulatory factors as is the case for the US and Europe in the form of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Association (EMA). To consider access to markets of the KTN respondent’s areas of operation by sector and size (both employment and turnover) were considered. 100% of all respondents indicated that they operate within the United Kingdom as can be seen in <link target-id=" import-auto-id1167549741812"/> with an interesting saturation of by sectors of the US, Germany, France, Other Western Europe and China with above 50% of most sectors in operation in those regions. Within the respondents of the KTN is the Manufacturing sector that has a higher proportionality of operation within Canada, Australasia, India, Other Asia, Central/South America and Other Eastern Europe. Manufacturing traditionally is more mature in their growth phase and are more financial stability, and has slower growth, with high emphasis on spending and cost control, and less emphasis on R&amp;D and growth strategies (Rudd 2008). These “Cost Control” may well be the reasons of choosing these locations as they historically have a low labour cost. Whereas the Bio-Tech sector, populated with more small companies (<link target-id=" import-auto-id1167549741812"/>) has a higher proportionality of areas of operation that have a larger market share and comparative advantage/influence as Davies &amp; Weinstein 1999 and Hanson 2005 argue, and a more traditional decline in areas that are have less of a market advantage/influence. </para><figure id="import-auto-id1167549741812"><media id="import-auto-id1167547349957" alt="">

As could be expected and seen in <link target-id=" import-auto-id1167544816641"/> and <link target-id=" import-auto-id1167543755384"/>, small companies find it hard to cover more space less geographical cover than large companies.

        <caption>Overall region(s) operational per annual revenue size. </caption></figure><para id="import-auto-id1167550686247">Interestingly though looking at areas of operation by annual revenue the companies less than £10m annual revenue are more evenly spread globally. This may be due to several factors that could leverage low cost advantage to them i.e., knowledge hubs and expertise in those locations.  University expertise and knowledge, especially in the field of Nanotechnology, is important to the growth of companies and ability to innovate.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167543279815">As can be seen in <link target-id=" import-auto-id1167549741812"/> and <link target-id=" import-auto-id1167544816641"/> that there a good proportion of both small and large companies spread through the more developed region that have a stronger ability to manage and regulate as would be expected large companies with higher annual revenue have a high percentage of global spread where those with annual revenue less than £10m have a smaller distribution globally.  Yip et al. 2006 argues, “Managers of the large British companies need to be competitive internationally” (Yip et al. 2006). Yip et al. 2006 and Osegowitsch 2008 argues that revenues is a metric indicating the ability of a company to work globally, where as they are a better and more stable indicator over time because small enterprises can have very large market capitalisations (Yip et al. 2006, Osegowitsch 2008). Malbert et al. (2003) notes that companies of different sizes tended to do different things in their implementations of their resource planning and that there were differences in the outcomes and benefits attained by the enterprises.  This follows suit to the regional importance to the respondents in the KTN questionnaire. In the case of China interestingly the literature argues that the Chinese Nationals educated abroad in technology fields are moving back to China as it is becoming a more Technology Economy (Bradsher 2010). </para><para id="import-auto-id8110797">Whereas both small and large companies operate 100% in the UK it is interesting how of course due to the amount of revenue that the larger companies have they have a higher spread globally. Within the respondents of large companies, USA, France, Other Western European Countries, China and Australasia were populated over 50% by the large companies and followed by Japan, India, and Scandinavia all above 40%. Within France and Other European Countries the reason for operating in those regions may be due to the Regional Funding Assistance that is located within Europe.  As for China and India, India has focused their efforts on high technology growth as a means of fuelling economic development, rather than relying only on streams of foreign aid or the more traditional approach to development in “stages of economic growth” typically advocated for developing economies (Parker 2008) as they seek to modernize through heavy investment in industrialization. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167555467121">When looking at the location of where companies operate on their size <link target-id=" import-auto-id1167544816641"/>, the large companies have a higher percentage of wider global spread than the small companies.  Large companies being more mature have a tendency in laying out extensive funds for infrastructure look for more cost savings in working in locations where labour cost is low, possibly the reason for the high proportion of the large companies with employees of over 100 employees 44%; and 49% of the large companies identified by having annual revenue of over £10m operating in Other Asia.</para><para id="import-auto-id1167544324949">Interesting was to find that even with the size of the companies being under 100 people there was a global spread <link target-id=" import-auto-id1167544816641"/>; they appreciate the opportunities that the wider world can offer. Quinstas et al. 1997 and Davenport 2005 argues Knowledge-acquisition is one part of knowledge management which, in turn, has been defined as “the process of critically managing knowledge to meet existing needs, to identify and exploit existing and acquired knowledge assets and to develop new opportunities”. Geographic proximity to the knowledge sources with which the organization is collaborating is generally assumed to assist knowledge-acquisition. Much of the advantage of such collaboration is thought to come from efficiencies in collective learning (Belussi 1999, Davenport 2005), particularly for innovative firms. Whether understood as generating economic externalities or spillovers of R&amp;D (Krugman, 1991; Audretsch and Feldman, 1994; Feldman, 1994) or facilitating inter-organisational transmission of tacit knowledge via social capital (Powell et al., 1996), geographic proximity is thought to be important for innovative activity. “Since knowledge is generated and transmitted more efficiently via local proximity, economic activity based on new knowledge has a high propensity to cluster within a geographic region”(Audretsch, 1998). Davenport 2005 states that, “Any exploration of geographic proximity leads directly to studies of successful knowledge sharing clusters”.</para><para id="import-auto-id8860714">

        <para id="import-auto-id1167548044521">Localisation, regional innovation systems, industrial districts, learning regions, local production systems and agglomeration economies are other labels given to the trend of geographically co-located firms in a value chain collaborating in some way in order to gain efficiency (Rabellotti and Schmitz 1999). The observation of regional cluster economies is not new with most writers referring back to Marshall’s work <emphasis effect="italics">Principles of Economics</emphasis>, originally published in1890 (Marshall 1986, Keeble and Wilkinson 1999). A rise in the number of studies of industrial districts and small-firm led economic growth in the 1980s combined with the increase in interest in ‘networks’ and social aspects of inter-organisational interaction (Granovetter 1985, Burt 1987, and Gulati, 1999) is the result of renewed activity on the part of scholars in such disciplines as economics, planning, sociology, strategic management, organisational behaviour and business history (Harrison 1991). The seeming paradox of the rise in “importance of local proximity and geographic clusters precisely when globalization seems to dominate the economic activity” has been attributed to the fact that more innovative activity is associated with high-tech SME clusters than with “footloose multinational corporations” (Audretsch 1998).</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167543337830">Definitions of clusters range from those that defer mainly to the geographic collectivity (<emphasis effect="italics">“geographic concentrations of interconnected companies and institutions in a particular field”</emphasis> (Porter, 1998)) to those that emphasise the knowledge sharing aspects of such groupings: <emphasis effect="italics">“Firms and organisations involved in clusters are able to achieve synergies and leverage economic advantage from shared access to information and knowledge networks, supplier and distribution chains, markets and marketing intelligence, competencies, and resources in a specific locality”</emphasis>, (Davenport 2005). Yet these respondents as previously identified as SMEs are not interested in certain aspect of access to specific equipment or sector specific material such as access to Biologic material for Biotech companies or “certified” procedures for regulatory approval. Yet they all identified a magnitude of importance of over 60% for access to testing and validation facilities for their products. </para>

        <para id="import-auto-id1167553496043">Within this study consultancy was able to be captured and although both groups engage in consultancy activities the TX/UK researchers are 60% more engaged in consultancy activities than the control research group, this could infer that those researchers within research collaborations networks have a greater opportunity to gain consultancy through the network.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167547602624">Both cohorts also reported a number of spinout and newly formed companies.  Within the TX/UK cohort there were 2 spin-out companies formed over the past three years compared with none amongst the control group. Compared with a broader definition of newly established companies (i.e., including spin-in and other routes) the TX/UK researchers founded five newly formed companies to the Control group’s one. </para>

          <para id="import-auto-id1167557616173">The focus of this study was to see in its most basic form, whether a region is able to leverage an international research network for economic development. In this case the two research groups were asked what kind of collaboration were they involved in; a 1-1 collaboration; where one entity was involved with the single respondent was in operation in a single local, and Multi Partnership collaboration where by a single respondent was involved with an entity that involved multi locations within an identified geographical location. Interesting enough was the fact that within both groups all researchers worked in an equal proportion of 1-1 collaborations within Wales, thusly inferring that there is proportional academic economic spill-over within the region, with the TX/UK researchers having a higher proportional engagement outside of the region than the control. </para>

Wales being a small country it is easy to meet with the decision makers to be able to facilitate opportunities.  Swansea has been able to increase the research funds of the Medical and Engineering schools due to this collaboration inclusive to this they have brought not only World Class Medical and Engineering Science and Experts to Wales but taken the best in Wales to Texas. Opportunities like this to create a streamlined framework of capturing the benefits while capitalising on the opportunities should not be missed.

By tying into the TX/UK Collaborative we gain access to one of the World leading cancer research centers and are able to bring to bear the value of phase II trials for research in Texas. Building throughput of new products and processes will allow the Welsh NHS to maximise on its strategic investments with Universities, especially Swansea University.

This matters because, as you can read in the recent report, "United States Space Policy: Challenges and Opportunities Gone Astray," published by the American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences, in today's world, technology is critical to this country's leadership role. We don't manufacture a lot of goods anymore, but we have maintained our leadership role with our technology. Without the input of bright, innovative young people, that leadership role is going to be affected. Look at all the problems we need to address -- the environment, alternative energy sources, health care and our aging infrastructure, not to mention space exploration.

This has proven to be quite valuable in that Swansea University is in discussions with a partner institution, Texas A&amp;M University in developing a Trials pathway for such innovations to take advantage, by in partnership conducting Phase I trials at A&amp;M and Phase II in Swansea. This allows the training of researchers in the procedures required for both Phase I &amp; II trials but gives them the understanding of translation to regulatory approvals in both the US and EU. </para>

This means that initiatives such as the Texas/United Kingdom Collaborative which give regional researchers access not only to world-class expertise and facilities, but also to new markets and opportunities for creating the needed value generation. Their thesis therefore suggests that such activities should not only be merely encouraged, but actively supported to realize their wider regional benefit.</para>

          <para id="import-auto-id1167554670391">Was not involved directly in Phase I or Phase II but via the Bioengineering at Texas A&amp;M. The importance of access to facilities are a key driver in the fact of the difficulties within the UK in conducting Phase I Clinical Trials where as in Texas is quite easy. It was identified that the access to Phase II Clinical Trials was much easier in the UK; we identified an opportunity for building off one another to gain advantages for both locals, Texas for access to Patients and Human Trials in Swansea and for Swansea the Phase I animal trials. Interestingly, other colleagues of mine that are in more into the Texas/United Kingdom Collaborative have given their endorsement, Dr. Mauro Ferrari, the author of the US National Institute of Health’s; National Cancer Institute: Novel Technologies for Non-invasive Detection, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Cancer, Special Emphasis Panel (Chair); Executive Office of the President of the United States of America: Nanotechnology Research Directions: National Science and Technology Council, Committee on Technology, Interagency Working Group on Nanoscience, Engineering and Technology, President of the Alliance for Nano Health informed me that Swansea was the first international member to the Alliance and that he knows first hand that the people and facilities are putting out world class science. For Texas A&amp;M it id the opportunity to build and increase the universities R&amp;D and assist in the universities 3<sup>rd</sup> mission of engaging in economic development. We see a great opportunity for companies in Wales, UK, and Europe to work with us through Swansea University as it gives us a complete regulatory pathway for approving medical devices and therapeutics in two of the world’s largest markets. It also is a benefit to have the capable people in place in Swansea to allow this facilitation and framework to be put in place. For us its about the People, Science, and Economic out puts, while keeping the over arching Governance flexible enough to allow room to breath on both sides of the pond, yet staying within the boundaries. Framework is the word I will choose with capable people like Theresa Fossum and Mike Pishko on our side and Jim Abbey, John White and Steve Bain on the Swansea side. </para>

          <para id="import-auto-id1167557213040">The Alliance for NanoHealth (ANH) saw the opportunity to create a mechanism for collaboration through with Swansea University and in so doing created the International Affiliate Center (IAC) program. Upon visiting Swansea University in 2008, he was very excited to take at the research that was being conducted and from that decided to take preliminary steps in establishing a formal relationship with Swansea University. Dr. Ferrari also stated that he has great expectations from this developing international collaboration and hoped that the affiliation with the Alliance for NanoHealth supports the endeavours of the Centre for NanoHealth not only in the European Union but globally. Inclusive to this was stated that by linking in the global centers and training the next generation of researchers and regulatory agents, new novel Nano-therapeutics could make it into mainstream medical and healthcare, by working in partnership between Academia, the Private Sector and Government this is achievable.</para>

          <para id="import-auto-id1167556198817">The “Collaborative” gives the opportunity for not only meeting great minds in Texas but brings Wales’ minds to Texas. It also broadens the research by creating synergistic links, building on similar pathways but using different approaches. Capitalising on the knowledge bases both in Texas and Swansea has allowed Swansea University to win pivotal research funding awards and has highlighted the capabilities of the collaboration between the Schools of Medicine and Engineering. Inclusive to this is the similar mindset of creating value, whether it is by the research to better Human Heath, the ability to assist R&amp;D of companies or the training of the next generation of researchers who value “Multidisciplinarity”.</para>
